That’s why Sentry Event Decoder draws a bold dashed red line from the root span straight to every error.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">How It Works</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">We traverse the tree recursively. Any span with <code>status !== "ok"</code> triggers a path collection. Every edge on that path becomes a thick, dashed red line — impossible to miss.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Real Incident Example</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Last month a payment webhook was failing intermittently. Sentry showed 47 spans. The error was buried 6 levels deep in a background job triggered after checkout.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">With the dashed red line? I saw the problem in 2 seconds: a cache.get returning 500 that caused the entire chain to fail.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Why This Beats Sentry’s Default View</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Sentry shows errors in a list. You still have to mentally trace parent_span_id chains. The red propagation line does that work for you — visually.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1li990r"><summary class="svelte-1li990r">What if multiple spans fail?</summary> <p class="svelte-1li990r">All failing paths get red dashed lines. You’ll see every error source instantly.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1li990r"><summary class="svelte-1li990r">Can I click the line?</summary> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Not yet — but the failing spans have red borders, so they’re easy to spot and select.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-1li990r">In debugging, the fastest path from chaos to clarity wins. The red dashed line is that path.</p></article></div>');function I(p){var e=k();b("1li990r",m=>{var a=_(),v=g(y(a),6);t(4),l(()=>n(v,"content",`${h??""}/blog/posts/post5`)),u(()=>{f.title="Finding the Real Root Cause with Error Propagation Paths | Sentry Event Decoder"}),r(m,a)});var s=i(e),d=i(s);t(4),o(s),t(2),o(e),l(()=>n(d,"href",`${h??""}/blog`)),r(p,e)}export{I as component,x as universal};
