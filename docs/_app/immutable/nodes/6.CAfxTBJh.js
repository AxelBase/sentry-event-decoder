Or in a data center with no Wi-Fi. Or on-call at 2 AM and Sentry is slow. An alert just fired. You need the trace <em>now</em>.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">That’s why Sentry Event Decoder was built as a full Progressive Web App (PWA).</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Install Once, Use Forever — Offline</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">After your first visit, the entire tool is cached locally using a Service Worker. All libraries (vis-network, html2canvas, FileSaver) are bundled and cached. You can close the tab, turn off Wi-Fi, and reopen — it just works.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Manual JSON Paste = Zero Dependencies</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Since public event JSON fetching isn’t possible (Sentry requires auth), we made the best possible UX: just copy the JSON from Sentry and paste it. No upload. No server. Instant render.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Real Offline Incident Story</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Last month, I was on a flight when a critical alert came in. I opened the installed PWA, pasted the JSON I’d saved earlier, and within 10 seconds knew a third-party API was timing out. Fixed on the ground. No internet needed.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Performance Matters</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">The app loads in less than 800ms on repeat visits. The trace renders in less than 200ms. Total time from paste to insight: less than 3 seconds.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1al8b51"><summary class="svelte-1al8b51">How do I install it?</summary> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Chrome/Firefox will show an install button. Or click “Add to Home Screen” on mobile.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1al8b51"><summary class="svelte-1al8b51">Does it work on mobile?</summary> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Yes — fully responsive. Paste JSON on your phone, pinch to zoom the trace.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1al8b51"><summary class="svelte-1al8b51">What if I clear my cache?</summary> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Just reload once with internet — it re-caches everything automatically.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-1al8b51">In debugging, speed isn’t a feature — it’s oxygen. This tool gives you air when you’re drowning in alerts.</p></article></div>');function N(d){var e=O();g("1al8b51",m=>{var s=S(),h=b(u(s),6);t(4),r(()=>i(h,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post3`)),f(()=>{y.title="From Event ID to Full Trace in 3 Seconds (Even Offline) | Blog"}),l(m,s)});var a=n(e),v=n(a);t(4),o(a),t(2),o(e),r(()=>i(v,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),l(d,e)}export{N as component,k as universal};
