PagerDuty screams. “P95 checkout latency greater than 15s”. 40% of users affected. Stakes: very real money.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">I opened Sentry Event Decoder (already installed as PWA), pasted the worst offender’s JSON, and hit Parse.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">3 seconds later: a bright red dashed line pointed straight to a db.query that took 12.4 seconds. The description? <code>SELECT * FROM order_items WHERE order_id = $1</code> — repeated 87 times.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">The N+1 That Almost Cost Us Black Friday</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">A new feature had eager-loaded order items in a loop. Classic N+1. In dev: 3 items. In prod: 200+ items for some users. Boom.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">How the Tool Made It Obvious</h2> <ul class="svelte-jo8es1"><li class="svelte-jo8es1">87 identical red db.query spans</li> <li class="svelte-jo8es1">Dashed red line showing they all came from the same http.server parent</li> <li class="svelte-jo8es1">Total trace time: 18.2 seconds</li></ul> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">11 minutes after the alert, the fix was deployed: one JOIN query instead of 87 individual ones. P95 back to 1.2s.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Why This Tool Saved the Day</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Sentry’s UI was slow under load. This tool loaded instantly, showed the problem visually, and let me share a PNG proving the fix worked.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-jo8es1"><summary class="svelte-jo8es1">Would I have found it without the tool?</summary> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Eventually.
