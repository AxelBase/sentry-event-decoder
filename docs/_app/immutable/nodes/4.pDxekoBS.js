What if you could skip all that and see the full performance trace in under 3 seconds — even offline?</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">That’s exactly what <strong>Sentry Event Decoder</strong> does.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Built as a 100% client-side, open-source web app, this tool lets you paste any Sentry event JSON (or even just the event ID) and instantly get a full interactive trace visualization with:</p> <ul class="svelte-1tq17n3"><li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Red/Yellow/Green duration indicators (greater than 1s red, 500ms–1s yellow, less than 500ms green)</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Dashed red lines showing error propagation from root to failing span</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Zoom, pan, and collapse nodes powered by vis-network</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">One-click export to PNG or JSON</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Works completely offline after first visit (PWA)</li></ul> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Why I Built This</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">I was tired of waiting for Sentry’s UI during on-call incidents. When checkout slowed down for 40% of users, I needed to see the trace <em>now</em> — not after three loading screens. So I built a tool that works instantly, anywhere.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">No Login. No Rate Limits. No Data Sent.</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Everything runs in your browser. Paste the JSON from Sentry, and the trace renders immediately. No backend. No tracking. No data leaves your machine.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Real-World Use Cases</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Whether you're triaging a P95 regression, hunting down an N+1 query, or sharing a trace in Slack — this tool gets you answers fast.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1tq17n3"><summary class="svelte-1tq17n3">Can I use this with private Sentry events?</summary> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Yes! Just copy the full event JSON from Sentry and paste it — the tool works 100% offline.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1tq17n3"><summary class="svelte-1tq17n3">Is it really free forever?</summary> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Yes. Open source, no limits, no account needed. MIT licensed.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1tq17n3"><summary class="svelte-1tq17n3">Can I deploy my own version?</summary> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Absolutely.
